MakeClipart.py Deployment Instructions

1. Open the program file to edit.

2. Replace coordinates used with coordinates that correspond to
the location of different buttons used through the program, such
as the Magic Select button, the transparent canvas button, etc. Use
ScreenResolution.py to find coordinates for these buttons by running
the program while leaving the mouse untouched at the location
for which you need coordinates. 

3. After updating coordinates to match the location of different 
buttons on screen, find an image that would make good clipart. One
way to determine this is by finding an image with a foreground that
is a different color from the background. It is also helpful if 
the background is a solid color, but this is not necessary. 

4. Open the command terminal and ensure it is in the diretory where 
the program has been saved. 

5. Input "python makeclipart.py" into the command terminal.

6. Sit back while the mouse and keyboard begin inputs to open Paint3D,
pastes the image to the canvas, and starts the process of cutting out
the background. 

7. Command terminal will prompt you to check the outline of the 
magic select tool. Ensure that the entire foreground is selected
in the box. Then return to the command terminal and input "y".

8. Sit back while the mouse continues the magic select process. 

9. Command terminal will prompt you to select the now separated
background and resize the image to the canvas. Click on part of 
the background of the image, then press backspace to delete it. 
Then click on the remaining foreground from the image and resize 
to fit the canvas.

10. Return to the command terminal and input "y".

11. Sit back as the mouse changes the canvas to transparent, then starts
the saving process. 

12. Command terminal will prompt you to enter the file name for 
your new clipart!
